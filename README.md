Watchman’s Layouts is a layout for ergo keyboards with 42 keys, such as: corne / jian / jorne / jorian / quasi 42 / centromere / chimera ergo 42 / mooncake 42 / enki 42. The idea is to place all the symbols I use on the main layer: for example: “[  ] `- \”, which are often on an extra layer in other layouts. And also have a full set of modifiers for each hand. This is achieved through the use of Mod-Tap.

[Regular edition](http://www.keyboard-layout-editor.com/#/gists/246772cb72fa2de02354d5cb1add6b2b)
 – the layout is as close as possible to the layout of a regular keyboard: numbers, symbols and function keys are arranged in rows.

[Advanced edition](http://www.keyboard-layout-editor.com/#/gists/d5593906579fe6564cd1701fccca1e62) - a improved version of the regular edition. It was developed after several months of using the regular edition. It seemed to me more convenient to arrange to have all the numbers, all the symbols and all the functional keys in the form of clusters for use with one hand, arranged in the manner of a numpad.

[Numpad edition](http://www.keyboard-layout-editor.com/#/gists/ac3aeb8844fee4f92e167979eb98936a)
 – an option for those who often need a numpad and do not want to clamp two modifiers.  This is the same as the advanced edition, but instead of the navigation cluster, numpad is used.
